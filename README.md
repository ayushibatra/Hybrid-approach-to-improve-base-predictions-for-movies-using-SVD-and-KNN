# Hybrid-approach-to-improve-base-predictions-for-movies-using-SVD-and-KNN

The model gives an hybrid approach for predictions of movies using a combination of two models i.e. Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) and K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN).   

The goal of this project is to reduce the baseline error in SVD and use KNN for clustering.

The dataset used for the project is Movie Lens dataset which is available online.
